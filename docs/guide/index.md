# What is Barebones

Barebones is a customizable component library built for Vue 3 and Nuxt 3. Barebones provides common components with local configuation files to customize props and styles. At present Barebones comes with one default theme built with Tailwind, however can be used with any CSS framework or custom CSS. In future we plan to add a number of starter themes.

# Motivation

The motivation for Barebones came from the desire to have a framework that provided all the functionality we rewrite over and over again but with the freedom to not be tied to themes or forced to overwrite styles.
