Barebones provides common components with local configuration files to customize props and styles. At present Barebones comes with one default theme built with Tailwind, however, can be used with any CSS framework or custom CSS. In the future, we plan to add many starter themes.</p><hr><h1 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1><p>The motivation for Barebones came from the desire to have a framework that provided all the functionality we rewrite over and over again but with the freedom to not be tied to themes or forced to overwrite styles. That may seem strange when you see that Barebones allows themes but this is optional, all the style configurations for these themes are configurable locally meaning no dirty overwrites.</p>',6),s=[r];function n(h,d,c,l,m,u){return t(),a("div",null,s)}var _=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,_ as default};
